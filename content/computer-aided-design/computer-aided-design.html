<p id="intro">
For the Computer Aided Design assignment I model the press fit box system that's going to house the energy meter nodes I'm currently working for my final project.

<p><b>The Process</p></b>
<p>The modeling has been done in <a href="">Rhino 3D</a> and the rendering has benn done in <a href="http://www.chaosgroup.com/">V-RAY</a> for Rhino. This software are quite expensive unless you use it everyday. However there's a lot of free alternatives for modeling like <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">Sketch Up</a> and <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD,</a> or <a href="http://www.povray.org/">POV Ray</a> for rendering</p>
