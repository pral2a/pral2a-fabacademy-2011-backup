<p id="intro">
For the computer-controlled assignement we build a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIK">Great Invention Kit (GIK)</a>
</p>
<p>GIK's principles are 1. Scalability, 2. Material diversity and 3. Reversibilit. You can learn more about on <a href="http://cba.mit.edu/events/07.08.fab/Popescu.ppt">this</a> CBA presetation.</p>

<p>The project goal was to create a simple GIK module that allows me to build structures that could grow on complex and divers shapes although the module original simplicity. Another goal was to keep the module simple so I can easily turned on to a parametric design after the first tests will be done.</p>

<p>Design was done in Rhino and laser-cut on 1.5 mm cardboard. Next step is to bring the design to code and make it parametric using the cad.py (fab modules) cam environment.</p>
