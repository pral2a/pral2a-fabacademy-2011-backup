This site is a work in progress project where I try to create an small project viewer that asyncronous read .html files allowing you to navigate on them, creating a more dinamic display out of plain .html content. The main goal is to learn Javascript and the JQuery library.

<p><b>Mercurial Tips on Mac OS X</p></b>
<p>If you're using Mercurial on Mac you probably already noticed case-folding collisions are always a problem.</p>
<code>
$ hg update
abort: case-folding collision between somefile and SomeFile
</code>
<p>That's because Mac OS X and Windows, oposite to Linux and other OS's, aren't case-folding sensitive. Since  Mercurial 1.7.5  this problem seems to be more or less solve on Windows but it's still a problem on Mac.</p>
<p>The easiest solution is to setup the Mercurial <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CaseFoldExtension">Case Fold Extension</a>. Here are the steps you should follow:
</p>
Download the Extension on your Desktop.
<code>
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bradobro/hgfold
</code>
Copy the Extension to your libraries directory.
<code>
$ sudo cp -r hgfold /usr/local/bin/hgfold
</code>
Go to your mercurial repository root.
<code>
$ cd ~/your_repository_folder
</code>
Edit the your repository hgrc file
<code>
$ open .hg/hgrc // you can also edit it with Nano or Vim
</code>
On extensions add the path to your extension
<code>
[extensions]
fold = /usr/local/lib/hgfold/fold.py
</code>
Done it! Now every time Mercurial shows you a case-collision problem just type.
<code>
$ hg update --fold 
</code>
